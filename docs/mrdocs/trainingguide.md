{: .text-blue-000}
### Starting the training
Hosts are required to join in at XX:40 along with the Co Host.

Training Host: @session ping A training hosted by (username) is starting in 15 minutes! Any LR staff join in before xx:55 to get trained!.
{: .text-blue-100}

### Line Checking

At XX:50 the co host needs to teleport all trainees to the Training Hall and check to see if they have their lines. The Co Host should say these three lines depending on the Trainers lines. Meanwhile, the Host starts the Introduction.

Co Host: Please say all three Dark Yellow lines listed in the training guide!
{: .text-green-000}

Co Host: Correct! You also need to use the lines while training!
{: .text-green-000}

Co Host: Incorrect! Please correct your previous line!
{: .text-green-000}

If the trainer stil sends the wrong line, you may kick the player with the reason: "Dismissed. Reason: Failure to correct trainer lines."

### Locking the server

At XX:55 the host should send this announcement to the communications server.

Training Host: @session ping The training has started and the server is now locked. Missed your chance to join? Your always free to attend another training session! 
{: .text-blue-100}

After making the announcement, the Host should run the command **:slock**

### Training Introductions

Also at XX:55 the host should send a few announcements in the training center before starting the presentation.

Do not send the announcements too fast either. Wait for preivous one to disappear before sending the next one!

Training Host: :sm Welcome to todays training! We will start shortly! But first, let me explain a few rules.
{: .text-blue-100}

Training Host: :sm 1. You are not allowed to talk while the presentation is going.
{: .text-blue-100}

Training Host: :sm 2. Before the trainers start to tell you what to do at any section, you can ask questions then.
{: .text-blue-100}

Training Host: :sm 3. Treat everyone with respect. Keep this in mind as well: "Treat everyone how you want to be treated."
{: .text-blue-100}

Training Host: :sm Please pay attention to the screens, as the presentation is now starting!
{: .text-blue-100}

The host should now open the host settings panel and click the **TV Settings** page button at the top of the settings frame, and then press **Start Presentation**

### After Presentation

After the presentation is over, you can teleport to a random trainer and head to the training hall door.

At the training hall door, teleport all the LRs to a station at Area 1 (Reception and Housekeeping training.)

After all the stations have been filled, you may now supervise.

### Moving LRs

Once a station has finished their training, you may teleport their trainees to a Area 2 (Cafe Training) station and teleport any remaining LRs to the previous trainers station.

Once all the Area 1 trainers are empty, you may dismiss all of them.

Once one of the area 2 stations have finished their training, you may teleport their trainees to a Area 3 (Security Training) station.

After there are no more Area 2 Trainees, you can dismiss the Area 2 Trainers as well.

After all the training at Area 3 has finished, You can set all the LRs that need ranking with a "Requrires Promotion!" tag located at Host Settings' Player UI page.

You can then teleport any passing LRs to the backstage and let the rankers promote them!

After all the LRs have been teleported, you can dismiss Area 3.

### Ending the training.

Once all the LRs have been ranked, it is up to you to take a screenshot with You, the Co Host, and any of your rankers!

You can then shutdown the server.

The host should then finally announce:

Training Host: The training has ended! If you didn't make it, don't worry as you are always welcome to attend another one!.
